The Assignment was completed and submitted on 7th April, 2019. The main aim of this assignment was to create own Convolutional Networks from scratch and then learn to adjust the hyper-parameters like filter-size, number of convolutional layers, srides for maxPooling etc to get higher accuracy. The above was performed on both the line dataset and the MNIST Dataset.
Next, we learnt the implementation of multi-head classifier to classify data based on different features like thickness, length, color and angles on different heads.
The last part of the assignments focuses on visualizing the output of hidden layers, visualizing the convent filters and also creating heatmaps which specify, where in the image the probability of that particular class is higher.
