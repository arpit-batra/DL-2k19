The Assignment was completed and submitted on 15th March, 2019. The Assignment helped us to appreciate the use of TensorFlow and its use to make computational graphs. We learnt certain TensorFlow elements like, PlaceHolders, Numpy Broadcasting, Variables, Sessions and much more.
We also learnt the implementation of Fully Connected Nueral Networks from scratch, resulting in classification of digits from 0-9 on MNIST Dataset.
